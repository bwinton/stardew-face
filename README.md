# Stardew valley clock face

[How to get it running.](RUNNING.md)

## Notes

- The seconds option disables am/pm display when selected (if time mode set to 12 hours).
- Scrolling formula looks like [this](http://www.iquilezles.org/apps/graphtoy/?f1(x)=sin(x*16)&f2(x)=sin(x*4))
- Ducks are sleeping between 8pm to 7am.


## Todo:

[] Add the battery percentage on the second screen.  
[] Add the heart rate in large on the second screen.  
[] Add the weather on the second screen.  
[] Figure out why the ducks move weird sometimes. (Screen-size related?)
